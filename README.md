# project purpose

The [National Head Start Association](https://nhsa.org/) is a leading provider of early childhood education and development programming for the most under-served children in America. They conduct [community needs assessments](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/program-planning/article/community-assessment-matrix) to help plan and target their resources. One pain point of producing these reoccuring, highly labor intensive reports is navigating census data for the required metrics at the county and census tract levels. For our Master's capstone project, my team developed a web app to not only serve this basic need with a user-friendly interface, but also provide helpful graphs and map visualizations of the metrics at the census tract level in the context of existing Head Start locations (a result of ongoing user needs communication with the client as the project progressed). I was the lead developer on the team.

Although we hosted the app on Heroku for demo purposes at the time, this was retired at the conclusion of our project, and the code was turned over to the next team for continued refinement. This repository contains my local staging version of the app. It can be run locally by installing the requirements and running index.py.
